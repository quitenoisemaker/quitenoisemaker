# 👋 Hi, I’m Samson Ojugo

I'm a Lead Software Engineer at [Cargoplug](https://getcargoplug.com), a Techstars 2024 company, where I build scalable solutions for logistics and verification systems. With a deep passion for clean code and innovative problem-solving, I specialize in **PHP**, **Laravel**, and full-stack development, delivering robust applications that drive impact.

## 👀 What I’m About
- Crafting efficient, maintainable code with a focus on minimizing technical debt.
- Building tools like [`Quitenoisemaker\ShippingTracker`](https://github.com/Quitenoisemaker/ShippingTracker), a Laravel package for real-time shipment tracking and webhook handling.
- Sharing insights on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samsonojugo) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@samsonojugo) about PHP, Laravel, and software engineering best practices.

## 💞️ Let’s Collaborate
I’m excited to work on projects that challenge my creativity and technical skills. Whether it’s building APIs, optimizing Laravel applications, or exploring new tech, I’m in! Have an idea? Let’s make it happen.
